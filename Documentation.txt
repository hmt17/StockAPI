So I decided to use MongoDB to store the trade records because there is a lot of really helpful functionality between NodeJS and Mongo.
The only issue I found with using Mongo was I couldn't specify the character length of the String types - they are all defaulted to
255bit, which depending on how large the database gets could waste a significant amount of memory. For this scenario I didn't 
have to find a work around, but in a real life problem this would need to be validated that the values were the correct size.

I chose to use the express framework, as suggested, and also chose to use Mocha and Chai for the testing framework to make
building and testing the different API calls much easier. 

Other things I had considered adding was configs for two seperate databases - one for dev/stage and one for testing; however, it was 
unnecessary for this project.

I left out the node-modules folder, I believe it will get built out with the project locally. I believe MongoDB needs to be 
installed locally in order to get the `npm start` command to run. I used this version if there are any issues starting the
application: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
